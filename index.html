          <h3>British graffiti artist</h3>
          <h2>
            Banksy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Banksy (born 1974?, Bristol?, England) is an anonymous British 
            graffiti artist known for his acerbic and antiauthoritarian art, often done in 
            public places. Although he is particularly known for his stenciled art 
            featuring policemen and rats, over the years he has extended his practice to 
            include installation and performance. Banksyâ€™s art often appears 
            unexpectedly, and it typically causes a flurry of media attention. He 
            generally claims the work on social media after it has been spotted.

            Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and 
            subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti 
            executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. His works of 
            political and social commentary have appeared on streets, 
            walls, and bridges throughout the world. His work grew 
            out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved 
            collaborations between artists and musicians.Banksy says 
            that he was inspired by 3D, a graffiti artist and founding 
            member of the musical group Massive Attack.[5]
