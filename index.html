          <h3>British graffiti artist</h3>
          <h2>
            Banksy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Banksy (born 1974?, Bristol?, England) is an anonymous British 
            graffiti artist known for his acerbic and antiauthoritarian art, often done in 
            public places. Although he is particularly known for his stenciled art 
            featuring policemen and rats, over the years he has extended his practice to 
            include installation and performance. Banksyâ€™s art often appears 
            unexpectedly, and it typically causes a flurry of media attention. He 
            generally claims the work on social media after it has been spotted.
